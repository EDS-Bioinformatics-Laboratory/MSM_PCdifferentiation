# MSM_PCdifferentiation
Multiscale model of plasma cell differentiation (Mafalda + Martinez)

This repository includes code ONLY of MSM of plasma cell diferentiation in Germinal Centers. The GRN is based on Martinez et al., 2012. 
It is posible to simulate 2 scenarios: Plasma cell diferentiation based on AgHigh or on BLIMP1High levels.
Cd40 signal can be modeled 2 ways: Fixed Cd40 (=50) or cd40 dependent on affinity (=affinity*50). 
The switch from one to the other has to be done inside the code (for now).
